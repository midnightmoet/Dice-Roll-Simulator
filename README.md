### Dice Roll Simulator

This is a simple dice roll simulator that I made in JavaScript. It is a simple program that generates a random number between 1 and 6, and then prints it out to the user. It also asks the user if they would like to roll again, and if they say yes, it will roll again. If they say no, it will exit the program.
